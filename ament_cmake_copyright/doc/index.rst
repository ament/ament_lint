``package.xml``:

.. code:: xml

    <buildtool_depend>ament_cmake</buildtool_depend>
    <test_depend>ament_cmake_copyright</test_depend>

``CMakeLists.txt``:

.. code:: cmake

the package `ament_lint_auto <https://github.com/ament/ament_lint>`_ might
contain some useful information.

The documentation of the package `ament_cmake_test
<https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake>`_ provides more information on testing
